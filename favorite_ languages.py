#   As you can see at 1 the value associated with each name is now a list.
# Notice that some people have one favorite language and others have
# multiple favorites. When we loop through the dictionary at 2, we use the
# variable name languages to hold each value from the dictionary, because we
# know that each value will be a list. Inside the main dictionary loop, we use
# favorite_
# languages.py
# Dictionaries 113
# another for loop 3 to run through each personâ€™s list of favorite languages.
