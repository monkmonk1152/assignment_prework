# At u and v, the keyword in tells Python to check for the existence of
# 'mushrooms' and 'pepperoni' in the list requested_toppings. This technique is
# quite powerful because you can create a list of essential values, and then
# easily check whether the value youâ€™re testing matches one of the values in
# the list.

if user not in banned_users:

    # The line at u reads quite clearly. If the value of user is not in the list
# banned_users, Python returns True and executes the indented line.
# The user 'marie' is not in the list banned_users, so she sees a message
# inviting her to post a response.
