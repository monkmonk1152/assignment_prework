#  We first define a dictionary called users with two keys: one each for the
# usernames 'aeinstein' and 'mcurie'. The value associated with each key is
# a dictionary that includes each userâ€™s first name, last name, and location.
# At u we loop through the users dictionary. Python stores each key in the
# variable username, and the dictionary associated with each username goes
# into the variable user_info. Once inside the main dictionary loop, we print
# the username at v.
# At w we start accessing the inner dictionary. The variable user_info,
# which contains the dictionary of user information, has three keys: 'first',
# 'last', and 'location'. We use each key to generate a neatly formatted full
# name and location for each person, and then print a summary of what we
# know about each user x:
